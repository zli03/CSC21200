He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff named Milagro in the Gulf of Mexico Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish . 
In the first forty-five days of April a boy had been with him . But after forty days without a fish theboy’s parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and finally Salao , which is the worst form of unlucky , and the boy had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three goodfish the first week . 
It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled around the mast . 
The sail was patched with flour sacks from Havana  and, furled , it looked like the flag of permanent defeat .
The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his neck . 
The brown blotches of the benevolent skin Cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks . 
His blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his
hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords . 
But none of these scars were fresh . 
They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert . Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the Navy blue sea and were cheerful and undefeated . Santiago, the boy said to him as they climbed the bank fromwhere the skiff hauled up .
